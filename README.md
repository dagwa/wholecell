#### COMBINE-compliant implementation of the *Mycoplasma genitalium* whole-cell model

The goal of this project was to recode the [*Mycoplasma genitalium* whole-cell model](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22817898) into COMBINE-compliant standards to faciliate interpretation, reuse, and extension of the model, as well as to help researchers build additional whole-cell models.

This project was a part of the [2015 Whole-Cell Modeling Summer School](https://sites.google.com/site/vwwholecellsummerschool/) which aim to teach students about whole-cell modeling and systems biology standards.

This repository includes recoded versions of all of the submodels of the *Mycoplasma genitalium* model.
